# lab_analysis
A small set of tools I use for data analysis. Includes:
- general statistics tools: mean, std, std err, etc
- matplotlib utility functions
- I/O functions for nice printing of datasets and easy importing of data
- AUTOMATED ERROR PROPAGATION via the sympy library
- AUTOMATED FITTING via the sympy and scipy libraries

To use it, just import into your analysis script like you would a library. The provided template ipynb shows how to wrangle the import statement to make it work with a nested folder structure, but you can of course also place it directly in your workspace folder and it will work fine.
