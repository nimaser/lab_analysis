# lab_analysis
A small set of tools I use for data analysis. Includes:
- general statistics tools: mean, std, std err, etc
- matplotlib utility functions
- I/O functions for nice printing of datasets and easy importing of data
- AUTOMATED ERROR PROPAGATION via the sympy library
- AUTOMATED FITTING via the sympy and scipy libraries
